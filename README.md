Semantic Segmentation on Kitti Road Dataset using EfficientNet B0 in PyTorch

## Description: 
An encoder-decoder model is used to perform semantic segmentation on Kitti Roaad Dataset in PyTorch. The encoder encodes the input images onto a low dimensional discriminative feature set and the decoder projects back the learnt features onto the high dimensional pixel space. The encoder uses a pre-trained EfficientNet B0 model and the decoder uses Transpose Convolutional layers to upsize the images back to its original size.  

## Coming Soon!!
